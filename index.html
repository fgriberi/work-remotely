							Before reviewing the outline for today, I wanna introduce myself. As you can see, I like so much memes and gif, so I used them a lot. I think it’s a great way to share feelings or sensations.
							Well, My name is Frank, I'm 27 years old and I'm from a little town near to Rio 4. Like google say, I've a lot of social networks, but actually I don't use it so much. Ahhh, and just in case, I'm not Frank Ribery, the famous French soccer player, I would wish it, but not.

							So, what is work remotely? Nowadays is common to listen terms like teleworking, telework, home office, working from home, digital nomads, technomads, virtual assistants, working while in pijamas and among others, but what does really mean?
							Work remotely is just when people work for a company from their houses using the internet as a tool to communicate with their teams. No more, no less. But this is not possible for all jobs yet, so far it is possible for developers, designers, architects, what else, english translator, HR/Recruiting and writers for example. This is most common in IT companies because they have the infrastructure to maintain remote workers.
							In 2015, it was estimated that almost 45% of US employees worked remotely, mostly from home. By 2020, it is estimated that about 50% of the workforce will be working remotely.
							Here you can see some companies with full remote DNA (they don't have physical office)

						<aside class="notes">
							+ Working from anywhere and any time: thanks to technologies we are able to work from pretty much anywhere at any time of day, breaking the traditional 9-6 workday. Relocating is easy. And I Mean Anywhere!

							+ No daily commute: that means we can avoid the lengthy commute by car or bus which enables us to start our workday earlier and calmer.

							+ Flexibility: we are in charge of our own schedule. Sometimes  it is possible to work when we really want and this is so productive.

							+ Less costly: working from a remote location or from home, we can save up money on transportation costs and eating lunch out.

							+ Better health: we could have more time to practice physical exercises, we can work close to family, maybe same meditations or outside activities. This activities will make for a happier more productive workday.

							+ Less interruptions: working remotely allows us long work focused hours without the office distractions and it increases our productivity.

						<h2>The Cons (-)</h2>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- Lack of routine</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- No workplace social life</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- The challenge of the work/life balance</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- Blurred lines.</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- Distractions</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- Overlooked for promotions</code></pre>
						<pre><code class="fragment grow">- Complete dependence on technology</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							- Lack of routine: not all remote work is the same; some people do have to follow a schedule but others like freelancers not. Sometimes a routine is good to organize the workday.

							- No workplace social life: we can replace communication, but it’s not the same joking at the office or getting lunch together.

							- The challenge of the work/life balance: as I said before, we could have more free time but we need to make a clear distinction between workplace and home space. It can be a bit hard to “switch off” and stop thinking about work.

							- Blurred lines: sometimes tasks are not clear and there are a lot of missing info to understand the tasks.

							- Distractions: working at home means all distractions are possible, good and bad. For example, If you have  children around, they may demand your attention. Or the  constant access to social networks can be so bad for productivity.

							- Overlooked for promotions: many times the work done is not reflected to the manager. At the office, everyone knows when somebody is working or not. Only the result is seen, not the process.
							- Complete dependence on technology: we must be connected all time to response quickly emails and chats.

							I see remote working as a scale, with five points as a line from “not remote” to “fully distributed”.
							First, we must work for a company in office in order to get knowledge and learn the processes and all stuff. Then we need to negotiate some home office days to try and experiment how work from home is. Then, we need to arrange work from home. I think it’s important try with team in same timezone, then if we thinks this path is for us, the next step is work in a team distributed in differents time zone, and finally gets a distributed team without physical office.
